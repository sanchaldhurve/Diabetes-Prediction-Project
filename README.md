**Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning (R)**

Dataset from Kaggle with over 100,000 observations; used a balanced 3,000-sample subset for modeling

Executed a complete data analysis and modeling pipeline to predict diabetes based on demographic and clinical variables (age, BMI, HbA1c, blood glucose, etc.). Performed thorough exploration, cleaning (handled missing data), and preprocessing (dummy variables, PCA). Applied unsupervised learning (K-Means, optimal k=2) and found limited clustering effectiveness. For classification, built and optimized KNN and SVM models. The SVM model achieved 89% accuracy and an AUC of 0.87 on test data, outperforming KNN. Evaluation included confusion matrices, precision-recall, and ROC analysis to validate model robustness.
